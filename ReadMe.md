#About ClassC
ClassC is a legacy multiple-inheritance C-based Object Oriented language, based on email exchanges I had with some guy, Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, who was developing an experimental language he called "C++"

Syntactically, ClassC is somewhere between Java & C++, with multiple inheritance. 

It is a compiled language - using LEX & YACC to first compile to "C", then whatever C compiler you have to compile down to machine code. It was subsequently adapted as a backbone to a NATO defense project, but I'm not allowed to release that version.

ClassC is not maintained, but is a useful reference for building tokenizers and compilers, and how to abstract classes/objects in a computer language.
