.H 3 "Object Deletion"
Each class may have a delete function defined for it as a member
component --

.DS
class String
	{ char * memLoc;
	  void delete();
		...
	};
.DE
.ls 2

This delete function may be called explicitly--

.I "myString:>delete();"

The expression 
.I "myString:>delete();"
will result in a call to the library function "_delete(myString);"
