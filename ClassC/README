ClassC/Elaine --- Copyright 1988 by Paul Kirkaas

ClassC/Elaine is an object oriented C based language.  It is a full superset
of C, barring only Enumerated types.

ClassC is similar to C++ and Objective C in that objects are implemented in
C structures.  

ClassC is different from C++ and Objective C in that it is somewhat slower,
but more object oriented.  The runtime system offers true dynamic binding
of objects, true multiple inheritance, and other features.  It differs also
in that it is not a finished commercial product, and has lots of rough
edges.   However, it does work; quite nicely, I think.

I developed this language for my Masters Thesis at the Rochester Institute
of Technology, where it has subsequently been used in classes teaching
object oriented programming.

The documentation is mainly in the form of my original MS thesis,
in the directory ./MSthesis.  The source for the parser is in the
directory ./parser.  The ClassC compiler takes ClassC source code and
translates it to standard (not ANSI) C, then calls cc to compile it.

The code is ugly to the extreme, but if you can make it through, I
think you will find some interesting uses of C, and a very interesting
implementation of Classes and Objects in C.

Let me know if you have any feedback.
